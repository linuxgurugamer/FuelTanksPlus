# FuelTanksPlus

Thanks to user @Krzeszny for fixing some issues in the fuelPatch.cfg file


IMPORTANT - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Some of the parts (see below) use some Squad textures.  Unfortunately, Squad has
been deprecating textures over time, some
of the textures it uses have been moved into the zDeprecated directory, and are
not directly accessible during loading.  This causes some textures to be missing.

To address this, I've provided a pair of scripts, one to be used on Windows and
the other to be used on both Linux & OSX.  These only need to be run one time
