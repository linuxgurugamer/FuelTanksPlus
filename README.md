Fuel Tanks Plus

Parts Pack

What is "Fuel Tanks Plus" exactly? Simply, it's a set of fuel tanks that are 1.5x the length of the largest stock tanks in each diameter, plus fuel-filled nose cones for those diameters. These tanks are meant to give you some visual choice of styles that are loosely inspired by real-world rockets from NASA, ESA, and private space firms (though that inspiration is mainly in color choice), while maintaining the style established in the Color Coded Canisters mod (since CCC replaces stock visuals, any "new" tanks should be spun off into a separate pack, and hence we have FTP).

Cooperates with other mods:

    TweakScale
    FAR/NEAR
    AVC (Add-on Version Checker)
    Deadly Reentry
    Modular Fuel Tanks
    Interstellar Fuel Switch

REQUIRED Dependencies: (version 1.0+)

    ModuleManager

    (for FTP versions prior to 2.0.0): Interstellar Fuel Switch (Core-only is OK). (Firespitter will also work)

Part of the NecroBones suite of mods, that work nicely together:

    Modular Rocket Systems (stock-alike parts pack, NASA-like alternatives, and filling the gaps)
    SpaceY Heavy Lifters Parts Pack (stock-balanced large rocket parts, 5m parts, large SRBs)
    Color Coded Canisters (replacement models/textures for stock fuel tanks: prettier, cleaner, and diameter color-coding for the tank end-caps)
    Fuel Tanks Plus (collection of large stock-like tanks with Color Coded Canister style)
    ColorFuel Lines (color-selctable fuel lines)
    Lithobrake Exploration Technologies (lander parts, large chutes/legs/ladders/etc)

Design Goals

Provide some new visual styles, to dress up the booster sections of your rockets.
Help mildly reduce part count and wobble, by providing larger tanks.
Be as memory efficient as possible. Each diameter has a shared texture to keep memory usage low.
Follow the same colors and artistic style established in Color Coded Canisters.
